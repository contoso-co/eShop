# NOTE: As of 1/20/2025, a bug prevents the use of inbuilt tasks with the ~ syntax for building your image into an image definition. 
# A bugfix is rolling out, and this issue will be resolved by 1/25/2024. 
# In the mean time, you can still use these image definitions with inbuilt tasks on a pool directly without building an image.
